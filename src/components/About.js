          <p className="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
          Having a formal background in computational linguistics, evidenced by my master's degree and comprehensive acumen in data science and NLP techniques, I can deliver quality technical project outputs to organizations consistent with their organizational goals.
Additionally, my professional experiences as a freelancer, marketing assistant, and supervisor, my interpersonal skills in communication, leadership, collaboration, and time management have been developed. I usually leverage these skills, alongside my analytical abilities, to execute analysis on datasets and develop algorithms that support the initiatives of businesses, including improved efficiency as well as customer experience.
